# CS22220-Software-Engineering-for-the-Web
A Module that I had taken within my second year of university where we were randomly assigned to a group & tasked to create a version of the quiz web-game, Kahoot.
Each group had 6 individuals with each assigned a role as if within a real world, Software engineering team. I was tasked as one of the two Front-end Developers 
whereby we would be creating all HTML, CSS & JavaScript code for the quiz web-game. 

Due to unseen circumstances, as well as bad team mates within our group, the Front-end developers including our Group leader had to pull 2 all-nighters in order to 
code, authentic unplagarized code for the Back-end (PHP). The PHP code that has been included within this repository has been coded from start to current state
amongst 3 of the group members, including myself.
